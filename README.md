# Flask-app
build SUMphora.site through flask

These are the code used to build the website: http://www.sumphora.site/, where you can find the automatic summary of helpful reviews
for product sold on Sephora's website. 

The website is based on the Bootstrap template that can be found through the following link https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/

I also thank the help from the author of the web app Rightstrain whose work can be found in the following repo: https://github.com/Chowcow/RightStrain
